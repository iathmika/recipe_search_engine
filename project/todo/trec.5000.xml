FT  02 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Growing optimism lifts Dow
Jones to record high

Wall Street
US STOCK MARKETS turned early weakness on higher bond yields into a
record-breaking performance yesterday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average
finished above 3,400 for the first time in its history, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was up 16.33 at 3,413.21, a near 40-point recovery from
its low of the early morning. Among other indices, the more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 1.93 to 417.25, the Amex composite rose 0.15 to
394.84 and the Nasdaq composite ended 3.21 higher at 588.37. Turnover on the
NYSE was 181m shares.
The dominant factor of the morning was bond prices, which fell almost a full
point at the long end (pushing the yield back up to nearly 8 per cent in the
process) as Treasury investors interpreted a strong May purchasing managers'
report as reducing the chances of another interest rate cut by the Federal
Reserve.
The selling in the equity markets, however, could not be sustained, and amid
growing enthusiasm about the outlook for the economy, share prices advanced
across all fronts late in the session.
The car sector led the way higher, with all three of the big car markers
rising as investors continued to anticipate a recovery in their fortunes.
General Motors rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 5/8 in turnover of 3.3m
shares, Ford added Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 46 3/8 in 2m shares, and
Chrysler advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 3/4 as 1.9m shares changed
hands.
Chrysler received an additional boost from Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street
broking house, which raised its earnings outlook for the group and predicted
profits in both the second quarter and the full year 1992. Salomon set a new
price target for Chrysler stock of Dollars 25 over the next 12 months.
After the opening of trading was delayed because of an imbalance of orders
on the sell side, Commonwealth Edison fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 31 1/2
in the wake of a warning from the broking house, Kidder Peabody, that the
company's current divided rate might be cut.
Citicorp climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 19 3/8 after Morgan Stanley
upgraded the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy', citing dramatic strides in
cost-cutting, peaking problem real-estate assets in North America and an
expected boost to earnings from strong franchises in emerging markets.
Waste Management rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 38 in heavy trading on the
news that the Supreme Court had ruled in favour of the group's subsidiary
Chemical Waste Management, which had challenged a special fee levied by
Alabama on out-of-state hazardous waste.
Canada
TORONTO Stock prices closed higher in moderate trading. According to
preliminary data, the TSE 300 rose 16.05, or 0.47 per cent, to close at
3,403.98. Advancing issues edged declines 276 to 259.
Volume of 22.8m shares was up from Friday's 20.3m, and trading value rose to
CDollars 303.3m from CDollars 223.8m.
Eight of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by the transportation group, up
2.2 per cent.
Laidlaw B, the most-heavily weighted stock in the group, rose  3/8 to 12 1/4
. Financial services gained 1.5 per cent and gold was up 1.0 per cent.
Industrial products also closed higher.
Magna International A tumbled 1 1/8 to 32 5/8 . The company said it plans to
issue 3.2m class A shares at CDollars 32.25 a share.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises on US indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR staged a recovery in late European trading on the foreign
exchange markets yesterday following signs of strong US manufacturing growth
last month, writes James Blitz.
Potential dollar buyers grew confident after the National Association of
Purchasing Management's index rose at its fastest pace in almost four years
to stand at 56.3 in May from 51.3 the month before. The survey's employment
index also jumped to 49.1 from 43.9 in April, its highest level since April
1989. The dollar closed at DM1.6100 in London, after a previous close of
DM1.6070.
However, there was still uncertainty in a number of traders' minds about the
scope and pace of the US economic recovery. The April figures for personal
income and consumption released yesterday were both weaker than expected.
These showed a 0.1 per cent rise in personal income in April, and a 0.3 per
cent rise in consumption.
According to Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in
London, yesterday's indicators may effectively add up to an ill omen. 'The
real danger is the mismatch in output gains and personal consumption,' he
says. 'If the increase in manufacturing output is not matched by personal
consumption there will be a build-up of stocks that will lead to a cut in
production in the third quarter.' Other economists believe that the market
needs more time to decide whether to invest in dollars. 'The market will
look at money supply figures on Thursday and the non-farm payroll on
Friday,' said Mr Nick Stamenkovic, an economist at DKB International in
London. 'Until we get signs of a stronger recovery the dollar will remain in
narrow ranges.'
Yesterday's good figures for business confidence in the US failed to
restrain the dollar's losses against the Japanese yen after the Bank of
Japan intervened to strengthen its currency for the fourth day running.
Analysts reckon that the BoJ has spent Dollars 500m in intervention
operations in the last four days, as it tries to reduce its huge trade
surplus in the run up to the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations in July. In late Asian trading, the BoJ pushed the dollar below
Y127, its lowest level for four months. By the end of the European trading
session, the dollar stood at Y127.40, after a previous close of Y127.70.
The Danish krone was well underpinned as the latest polls showed that Danes
will vote 'yes' in today's referendum on European economic and monetary
union. The krone remained at the foot of the European Monetary System's
grid, but at minus 34 per cent of allowed swing below its central Ecu rate,
after Friday's close of minus 37 per cent.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-TERM rates in the sterling cash markets ended slightly softer
yesterday after the Bank of England took what appeared to be an
accommodating position in its money market operations.
Most of the period rates remained unchanged, with everything from 4-month to
9-month Libor once again ending at 10 per cent, and 1-year Libor at 9 15/16
per cent. But 3-month Libor, a key indicator of where interest rates are
moving, ended at 10 1/32 per cent, down  1/16 per cent on Friday's close.
Short term clearing bank certificates of deposit were also slightly softer,
with 1-month CDs ending at 9 29/32 per cent from a previous close of 10 1/32
per cent, and 3-month CDs ending at 9 7/8 per cent from 9 31/32 per cent.
The softening of rates was partly due to the small size of the shortage
forecast by the Bank of England. At Pounds 750m, this was far smaller than
those of last week, which amounted to Pounds 7.6bn over four days. Dealers
said that the Bank of England had also taken an accommodating stance,
inviting offers of bills in the early round.
However, the market was extremely slow to remove the shortage, with several
dealers putting the blame on a shortage of bills.
As one dealer put it, the market is currently being squeezed between two
phenomena. On the one hand, there is the usual slowing down of the economy
over the summer, which means that few bills are being offered to the Bank of
England. But there are also large shortages to be taken out, mostly due to
the large number of gilt issues being offered by the Bank.
As a result, the Bank purchased only Pounds 86m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent in its early operations yesterday. The forecast was later
revised to a shortage of around Pounds 900m before taking account of the
early operations.
The Bank then purchased Pounds 75m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, and Pounds 10m for resale to the market on 22 June at an interest rate
of 9 15/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 20m of Band-1 bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 345m.
The cost of overnight funding jumped to 11-10 1/2 per cent at one stage and
closed at 9 3/4 per cent.

</HEADLINE>

   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's robusta COFFEE market saw early gains erased in the afternoon,
leaving the September contract unchanged from Friday's close. Dealers said
there was little follow-through buying interest after Friday's advance in
New York. The market could now settle down to trade in a narrow band ahead
of the first set of negotiations for a new coffee pact on June 22-26.
Dealers discounted some unconfirmed talk of cold weather in Brazil. LME
trading was mainly influenced by fluctuations in the sterling/dollar
exchange rate, with most metals ending below their highs. Three-month TIN
touched a 20-month high of Dollars 6,460 a tonne after European trade buying
touched off short covering and buy stops. While profit taking eventually
pared gains, chartists are still looking for a near-term target of Dollars
6,500. Nymex PLATINUM futures were firmer at midday as the fundamental front
continued to look bright. Analysts cited continued concerns over the
availability of physical supply, particularly in Europe, as well as
perceptions that European car companies are coming to market. The EC set the
end of this year as the deadline for new models of gasoline-powered cars to
have catalytic converters.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh 'mad cow' study urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Clark, the UK shadow agriculture minister, is to call for an
independent report into 'mad cow' disease, saying that the incidence of
infection is continuing to rise.
According to Mr Clark, there has been a weekly average of 631 new cases in
Britain in the four months to end-April 1992, compared with 437 last year.
This constitutes an increase of 45 per cent.
He plans today to table a parliamentary written question asking Mr John
Gummer, the agriculture minister, to convene a committee of independent
scientific experts to publish a report on the disease.
'In the pre-election period, the government was trying to con us that the
disease would start declining soon,' he said.
According to Mr Clark's figures, a total of 55,300 cases of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (as the disease is more properly termed) has now
been diagnosed, with the heaviest concentration in south-west England.
The ministry of agriculture yesterday did not dispute that the incidence of
infection was continuing to rise but said the number of new cases was
expected to peak very shortly.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS metal output lower than
estimated, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEAD and zinc production in the states comprising the former Soviet Union
has been nowhere near the level most western estimates suggest, claims the
Commodities Research Unit, the London-based consultancy.
It says lead mine output has been less than half the 490,000 tonnes widely
estimated by western analysts. Zinc mine production has been less than
two-thirds the previously estimated 870,000 tonnes.
The CRU bases its estimates on fieldwork and personal contacts within the
former Soviet Union. Metal production figures are still state secrets and
are not published by official sources in Moscow.
The consultancy's estimates suggest that the former Soviet Union was the
third largest producer of mined copper in 1990, after Chile and the US, with
an output of almost exactly 1m tonnes - not far short of figures given by
other western analysts.
'In spite of a policy of self-sufficiency under the former communist regime,
the Soviet Union was not self-sufficient in mine production of copper, lead
or zinc,' says the CRU in a special report produced in association with
Mekhanobr Institute, a technical research organisation based in St
Petersburg.
'More than 100,000 tonnes of copper in concentrates were imported from
Mongolia in 1988-90; imports of lead concentrates were recently as high as
12 per cent of smelter production, although they fell in 1991 because of the
shortage of foreign exchange; imports of zinc concentrates were more than 8
per cent of smelter production in 1990, but have also fallen since then.'
The CRU blames lack of investment in mine development and declining ore
grades for the weak state of the Soviet industry. It suggests that pollution
is of serious concern at all the Soviet copper, lead and zinc smelters and
is now starting to restrict production.
It suggests, however, that Russia and Kazakhstan, the republics dominating
base metal production in the Commonwealth of Independent States, 'could
become very attractive areas for investment by western mining companies.'
The Copper, Lead and Zinc Industries of the former USSR, Pounds 12,000 from
the CRU, 31 Mount Pleasant, London WC1X 0AD.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ekofisk oilfield back to full
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S EKOFISK oilfield was back in full production yesterday, less than a
week after being shut down following a fire in an air filter on one of its
platforms.
Phillips Petroleum, the field's operator, said Ekofisk was producing at
slightly above its usual output of 250,000 barrels a day, because of a small
build-up of pressure while the field was closed. The nearby Valhall and Hod
fields, linked to Ekofisk by pipeline, were pumping a combined 114,000 b/d,
up from their normal 100,000.
Gas supplies from Ekofisk to a consortium of European buyers via Emden in
Germany had also resumed.
NPD, Norway's oil industry watchdog, ordered the closure of the field on
Monday of last week pending clarification of the cause of a brief fire in
the air filter of a gas turbine.
Phillips said yesterday that the incident was the result of human error,
which led to a small explosion in the turbine following routine cleaning.
The company is changing the alarm system on its turbines as a result.
The fire occurred only hours before a planned maintenance shutdown that
would have closed the field for about 90 hours. Had the Ekofisk closure
lasted for an extended period, there were fears that this might have
affected production from the giant Statfjord and Gullfaks fields, with
combined output of more than 1m b/d.
The Ula and Gyda fields, which are also tied into Ekofisk, were not yet
producing because of maintenance work, Phillips said, but were expected to
be back on-stream soon.

DEPRESSED SILVER prices have prompted Asarco, the big US mining group, to
close temporarily its Galena silver mine in Northern Idaho. The mine, which
produced 3.3m troy ounces of silver last year, will be placed on a
care-and-maintenance footing.
Silver prices are at their lowest in real terms since the late 1960s and
there is little expectation in the market that they will turn around soon.
Asarco holds a 37.5 per cent interest in Galena's profits and Hecla Mining
Company has a 12.5 per cent interest.
Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation, the mine's owner and from which it is
leased, takes 50 per cent.
Lower metals prices shaved Dollars 100m off Asarco's last year's earnings of
Dollars 46m and they have continued to bite into this year's. The company,
which has spent heavily to expand, is keen to improve operating results.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mr Koskov's copper-bottomed
business plan - One of Russia's small but growing band of entrepreneurs
talks to Kenneth Gooding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VLADIMIR KOSKOV is offering holidays in Spain and Lada cars to encourage
people to collect the copper scrap that he says is liberally scattered
across Russia. Collectors are rarely interested in roubles, he says. So
student collectors can earn eight days in Spain for every half a tonne of
old copper they deliver. He has also bought 100 Ladas, each to be swapped
for four and a half tonnes of scrap.
Mr Koskov is one of a small but growing band of Russian entrepreneurs
battling a system that is proving resistant to change. Copper is central to
his plans for the future. He sees the metal as a certain way of converting
roubles into hard currency. But there is the little matter of obtaining
export licences.
He is certain his company will eventually get the licences it needs.
However, the situation is complex because the old bureaucracy knows there is
money to be made from the bribes for favours done when something is in
demand. 'The old system bred a criminal mentality,' Mr Koskov suggests. So
licences are for absurdly small amounts of copper, from 1,000 to 5,000
tonnes. The more licences to be issued, the greater the bribe opportunity.
Some will be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and some
by the regional authority in Ekaterinburg. The rest will be auctioned off to
the highest bidder at commodity exchanges.
Mr Koskov is a mild-mannered man of 40. He was head of automation at a
defence equipment manufacturing establishment before starting his own
business in 1988. This was a small consultancy co-operative involving seven
other people from the local polytechnic and the defence plant.
He had his first taste of the opportunities offered by exporting when he
swapped 100 Russian guitars for two computers. The guitars were to be sold
to students at Cambridge in England and Mr Koskov simply gave them to
someone who was about to take off from Moscow airport to London. 'There were
some problems with customs officers at Moscow,' he recalls with a smile.
'But I said, where is it written that an aircraft passenger can't take 100
guitars?'
Today his Teknesis group of companies, based in Ekaterinburg, has a wide
range of interests but the most important one at the moment is collecting
Russia's copper scrap and having it re-refined into metal suitable for
export.
He says that last year Teknesis exported about 10,000 tonnes of copper (as
well as 10,000 tonnes of aluminium, some tungsten and molybdenum). This year
he hopes to get licences to export 75,000 tonnes of copper from Russia.
Teknesis also has a deal with the Balkhash and Upper Pyshminsky refineries
in Kazakstan to sell all their production, perhaps 150,000 tonnes.
To put this into context, the former Soviet Union's net copper exports moved
above 100,000 tonnes for the first time only in 1989. Last year, as the new
Commonwealth of Independent States exported everything possible to raise
desperately-needed hard currency, net exports are estimated to have reached
312,000 tonnes.
Mr Koskov is storing copper in a warehouse at Le Havre, France, where it can
be used as collateral for loans from the Credit Lyonaise bank as well as
providing a buffer stock to ensure a smooth supply to customers. He says a
quality guarantee is given by the Societe General Surveillance of Geneva. He
has set up companies in France, England and Switzerland to handle his export
business, which he claims now has an annual turnover of about Dollars 100m.
Metal sales are organised by his London office. He describes the copper
operation as 'an enabler'. It is simply a way of raising the hard currency
he needs to push through ambitious plans for his business in Russia. He is
using the hard currency raised to import computers and other equipment into
Russia. His aim is to link the main business centres there through one or
two computer head stations eventually using about 30,000 terminals. He also
hopes Russia's newly-developing commodity exchanges will be linked via this
system and suggests that this link should help to stabilise the prices of
some goods.
There tend to be gluts of goods in some parts of the republic, particularly
at the ports, and severe shortages in others. Mr Koskov believes an
integrated commodity exchange system would reflect the overall situation
more accurately.
Teknesis is also setting up business centres in, initially, five cities
(Ekaterinburg, Moscow, St Petersburg, Khabarovsk and Novosibirsk) aimed
particularly at western companies that would prefer to move in when all the
equipment - telephones, computers, furniture and so on - is installed and up
and running - Mr Koskov is even offering Renault limousines as part of a
package for companies needing to ferry people to and from airports.
In spite of Russia's economic problems, he hopes to sell about 1,000 of
these business centres at 9m roubles each, or Dollars 65,000 or 70 tonnes of
copper. He says that, once the price is paid, he can guarantee an office
will be ready for occupation in 45 days.
Mr Koskov also is building up his copper business in Russia. His company is
supplying the Kazakhstan smelters - from a plant in Omsk - with a flotation
agent, needed in the refining process. The new agent, he claims, reduces
emissions of sulphur dioxide (one of the causes of acid rain) by 10 to 20
per cent.
He recently started to supply the flotation agent and scrap copper to the
huge Norilsk nickel-copper combine. Norilsk needs scrap for its smelting
process and in return Koskov is willing to buy refined copper for 300,000
roubles a tonne instead of the 70,000 roubles the Russian state export
agency would pay.
He is also selling copper to a pipe producer at Revda, near Ekaterinburg,
which in turn is exporting his products to France.
Mr Koskov says he set up his Swiss company to manage the group's finances
because the Russian banking system has virtually collapsed. According to his
statement of account, the Bank for Foreign and Economic Affairs owes his
companies Dollars 500,000 in hard currency. 'But the bank has no money. The
state took the money.'
He complains that, until recently, any person with hard currency and
apparently well-off was assumed by most Russians to be a criminal, part of
Russia's Mafia. That is now changing, he suggests. 'People are now beginning
to realise there are good as well as bad ways of making money.'
But the entrepreneurial spirit is still hard to detect in Russia. Mr Koskov
says he knows of only a handful of other Russian entrepreneurs and tells an
anecdote to illustrate his point.
A year ago he approached the management at the defence plant where he once
worked offering to help. They were not interested. But recently they called
him back. 'The plant was at a standstill. The managers were just sitting
there, twiddling their thumbs, waiting for something to happen.' He asked
them if the plant could produce car bodies if it was given a contract. Yes,
said the managers, but there was no capital and, even worse, they had to
dispose of 6,000 surplus missiles.
Mr Koskov had to point out that there were tons of valuable alloys, ounces
of precious metal and hundreds of expensive components to be reclaimed from
this missile stockpile.
Many other people in Mr Koskov's position would have taken the profit and
retired, perhaps to a sunnier climate. Why does he press on, combatting a
system and enduring the chaos?
He does not pause an instant before replying: 'It is sad for any man to see
his mother dying - Russia is dying and it is very painful for me'.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico embraces the
international financial markets - The share offerings and foreign listing
which have made an impact on the country's business methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past 12 months around a dozen Mexican companies have become
significant players in the international financial markets, issuing billions
of dollars in new stock and, in some cases, acquiring listings on Wall
Street.
Just a few years ago such events in Mexico would have been thought of as
laughable. Not surprisingly the speed and extent of the changes are having a
profound effect on Mexican business methods.
The share offerings have been spurred by the large financing needs of
industry which needs badly to catch up after a decade of weak capital
investment if it is to make the most of the proposed free trade pact with
North America.
The trend started in May 1991 when the Mexican government sold 14 per cent
of Telmex, Mexico's telephone monopoly, for Dollars 2.17bn, most of it in
American or Global Depository Receipts.
In all, Mexican companies placed about Dollars 4.8bn of stock at home and
abroad last year. This year Dollars 3.6bn has already been raised and a
further Dollars 2bn could be in issue before the year is out.
Companies as diverse as Telmex, Vitro, Mexico's largest industrial
conglomerate, and ICA, the construction company, are now listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, with more to follow.
Foreign investment in Mexican ADRs is now short of Dollars 20bn.
In part, the rush to sell stock abroad reflects the phenomenal rise of the
Mexican stock market and the desire of existing owners to cash on the high
earnings multiples being offered: and the issues have had to be
international since the Mexican stock market is far too small to absorb all
the paper on sale. The more so since more than Dollars 11bn of Mexican
savings have been used up to buy the country's privatised banks from the
government.
Most Mexican companies were starved of capital during the 1980s. They are
now having to invest heavily in a re-shape in order to compete under
Mexico's relatively open trade policy, and prepare for a North American free
trade area.
With foreign banks reluctant to lend directly, Mexican business has been
forced to tap foreign money through equity or bonds.
At the same time the large public offerings of Mexican stock are forcing
Mexican companies to face the discipline of the domestic and international
equity markets, and meet much tighter reporting requirements.
This marks a particularly profound change in management styles. In the past,
even some publicly owned Mexican companies were treated as little more than
personal fiefdoms, an approach which helped put many of the country's
largest companies into virtual bankruptcy in the early 1980s.
Mexican companies, prodded by the finance ministry, can see the benefits of
giving up their freedom to run companies as they wish: going public, or
being listed on foreign markets, cannot just reduce the cost of capital, but
attract foreign partners that might otherwise shun a third world company.
Mr Arturo Trevino, the director general of Gigante, the supermarket chain,
suggests that had it not been for his company's public listing, its joint
venture with the US's largest wholesaler Fleming could not have gone ahead.
Similarly, Mr Hugo Jaime Garcia, who is head of banking relations at Vitro,
says that his company's presence in global capital markets, while perhaps
demanding in terms of investor relations, 'reduces the aspect of Mexican
risk'.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Strong purchasing data trigger selling of
Treasuries

A MUCH stronger-than -expected National Association of Purchasing
Management's report triggered heavy selling of US Treasury securities
yesterday, although late in the day prices recovered from their lows.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  21/32 at
101 7/32 , yielding 7.887 per cent. The short end of the market was also
markedly weaker, with the two-year note off  5/32 at 99 23/32 , yielding
5.259 per cent.
The rise in the NAPM's index for May from 51.3 the previous month to 56 was
bigger than analysts' forecasts (which had centred around 54), and sparked
an immediate sell-off as hopes for another interest rate cut from the
Federal Reserve dwindled further.
The purchasing managers figures indicated the economic recovery may be
advancing at a faster pace than bond investors initially realised. The data
suggested that Friday's employment report for May could show an improvement
in labour market conditions.
UK government bonds ended the day lower, taking their cue from the US
Treasury bond market.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening level
of 118 9/32 to trade at 117 31/32 by late afternoon, yielding 9.07 per cent.
Short-dated gilts slipped by around  1/32 of a point, dealers said. The
Liffe gilt futures contract fell from its opening of 100.02 to end the day
at 99.23, but volumes in the futures market were lower than normal with
about 15,000 contracts traded.
The latest tap stock - the 9 per cent Conversion stock due 2000 - continues
to overhang the market, and dealers estimate that only about Pounds 200m of
the total Pounds 800m has been sold since it was issued on May 22.
The market will be watching today's final money supply figures for April
which are expected to provide details of exactly how much stock the Bank of
England sold after the April 9 general election. According to earlier
estimates, the Bank sold about Pounds 4bn of gilts immediately after the
election.
THE main European government bond markets slipped yesterday, following the
US Treasury bond market's lead and in the absence of significant economic
news on the domestic front.
German government bond futures drifted from their opening level of 87.87 to
end at 87.70, having traded in a narrow range of 87.69-87.89.
The Danish government bond market saw some profit-taking ahead of today's
referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on European Monetary Union.
In view of the most recent batch of opinion polls, traders expect Denmark to
ratify the Treaty, and the Danish bond market has already started to
discount a vote in favour.
Some traders reported switching out of Denmark into Belgium, a market which
has under-performed in recent days.
The yield spread of the Danish bond due 2000 over the 9 per cent Belgian
bond due 2001 narrowed from 16 basis points to 10 basis points yesterday.
A stronger yen against the US dollar helped to boost Japanese government
bonds yesterday, but the fall in share prices and the halt in the yen's rise
prompted profit-taking, and the bond market closed lower on the day.
The Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign exchange markets selling dollars
to boost the Japanese currency. The yen opened at Y127.15 in Tokyo trading
yesterday, against Y128.15 at Friday's Tokyo close, and strengthened to
Y126.6 in the afternoon at the peak of the central bank's intervention.
Traders noted some profit-taking as the yen slipped to reach Y127.15 against
the dollar at the end of the day. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened
at 5.475 per cent, ending in Tokyo trading at 5.50 per cent. The yield moved
to 5.515 per cent in London following the initial weakness in the US
Treasury bond market and the yen's failure to continue its strengthening
against the dollar.
Dealers noted the No 144, which matures in 2001 and has a 6 per cent coupon,
may soon take over as the new benchmark bond as the three separate No 144
issues are combining to form a single large issue.

CBS, the US television network that is controlled by the Tisch family,
announced yesterday that starting next year it would levy new charges on it
214 affiliated stations.
The announcement, which CBS justified in the light of adverse competitive
and economic conditions faced by both networks and affiliates, is an
unprecedented move that may trigger protests.
CBS said the new charges would be based on programming and market sizes. The
network estimated it would generate Dollars 20m to Dollars 25m of new net
revenues.
Wall Street reacted favourably to the new charges, marking CBS stock Dollars
12 5/8 up to Dollars 204 5/8.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P cuts debt rating on four
US airlines
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday downgraded debt
securities at four of the largest US airlines - a decision which, it said,
reflected the weak economic recovery and the domestic fares wars.
S&amp;P had placed the ratings of the seven leading non-bankrupt US carriers on
credit watch, with a view to a possible downgrading, in late-April.
The airlines affected by the downgradings are American, Delta, Northwest and
USAir. S&amp;P said it was still talking to management at United Airlines, and
that ratings of UAL, United's parent company, remained on credit watch 'with
negative implications'.
Of the four downgraded carriers, S&amp;P said that it believed only one -
American - had 'a chance to earn a profit in 1992'. It added that all should
report 'greatly improved earnings over the next several year,' but suggested
that 'the improvement in credit measures will be restrained by a heavy fixed
charge burden'.
At present, S&amp;P said, the rating outlooks on all four carriers remained
negative - suggesting that ratings could fall again if 'economic weakness
and/or fare competition prevents a return to levels of profitability'.
American attempted to overhaul the domestic fare structure earlier this
spring, but its initiative has since been hit by undercutting. Commenting,
S&amp;P said that 'the new fare structure initiated by American in April has
improved the mix of tickets sold but stimulation of business traffic and
shifts in market share have been modest.
'While airline managements disagree about the profit impact of the new
structure, most believe it will cause a net loss of revenue. More recent
leisure fare cuts will further dilute revenues in the coming months, despite
a flood of bookings,' S&amp;P said.
In the downgradings, the senior debt at AMR, American's parent, and American
Airlines itself was cut from BBB+ to BBB, for example; senior debt at Delta
fared similarly; at Northwest, it was cut from B+ to B; and at USAir the
senior secured debt was reduced from BB to BB-, and the unsecured senior
debt from BB to B+.
TWA, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, is laying off 300
employees at its maintenance base in Kansas City.
The airline, which made operating losses of over Dollars 100m in the first
three months of 1992, employs 4,000 workers at the base.
TWA said the 'furloughs' - temporary layoffs which can be reversed -
reflected a reduction in contract work from other carriers.

MCA, the Hollywood studio and entertainment group owned by Matsushita of
Japan, said its recreation services division planned to invest an additional
Dollars 200m in its two Universal Studios theme parks in 1992-93.
The investments in Universal Studios of Hollywood and Universal Studios of
Florida will match the capital spending planned for attractions in the
1991-92 season. The Florida theme park is a joint venture between MCA and
the Rank Organisation.
Increased revenues from feature films helped Carolco Pictures, the troubled
independent US film studio, improve its position for the quarter ended March
31, AP-DJ reports.
Net losses for the period were cut to Dollars 4.3m, or 27 cents a share,
compared with a deficit of Dollars 6.3m, or 20 cents a share, for the
year-ago period.
The result was struck on revenues of Dollars 136.5m, little changed from the
Dollars 136.6m last time.
Carolco said improved revenues from feature films helped offset a fall at
its 53 per cent-owned video subsidiary, LIVE Entertainment. Carolco said
feature film revenues rose Dollars 18.6m compared with the year-ago quarter.
It said 'in light of the current situation at LIVE and our continuing
efforts to effect a positive restructuring', it expected soon to retain an
investment banking firm to assist its recapitalisation.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Taxing times for multinationals
in Argentina - In 1983, companies such as Shell, Firestone and BAT
Industries entered the South American's government-sanctioned secondary
market in tax credits. But within five years, their experience became a tale
of fraud, corruption and taxation  - Argentine style
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEN years ago, a group of multinational companies operating in Argentina
embarked on a what then seemed a legitimate, if complicated, tax-reduction
scheme. But far from saving the companies a few million dollars a year, they
say the scheme became a nightmare of fraud, corruption and arbitrary
government that cost them about Dollars 100m.
An embittered executive now warns companies to 'think five times' before
investing in Argentina. He says: 'You must be very wary and mistrustful.
Everything carries risk.'
That jars with Argentina's new free market image as a country where the
rules of the business game are fair and predictable.
The story begins in 1983, when companies such as Shell, Pirelli, BAT
Industries, Perkins Engines, Texas Instruments and Firestone entered a
government-sanctioned secondary market in tax credits.
This involved Argentine companies that were entitled to government tax
rebates on one side and companies that owed the government taxes on the
other.
The Argentine companies won rebates on their investments in development
zones in deprived regions and on sales that originated in those regions.
Rather than wait for payment from the DGI, the bureaucratic and inefficient
tax department, they would 'sell' their tax credits at a discount. The
'buyer' - invariably a multinational - could then reduce its tax bill by
'paying' part of its tax bill with tax credits to the DGI at their full face
value.
One of the biggest players in the tax credit market was Koner-Salgado, an
Argentine conglomerate. It sold over Dollars 100m-worth of credits over a
six-year period.
But, in 1988, the DGI suddenly declared Koner-Salgado's credits worthless
after investigators said the company faked investments to generate tax
credits.
The DGI then ordered Koner-Salgado's clients to pay back all the taxes they
had 'paid' with its allegedly fraudulent credits.
But the multinationals point to the fact that the DGI investigation took
place in 1985, three years earlier. They say DGI officials suppressed the
report, failed to warn buyers of Koner-Salgado credits, and continued
accepting the credits until the report was leaked in 1988.
At first the companies refused to pay up, arguing they were being made to
pay for a crime committed by others. They alleged that the DGI had acted in
bad faith.
The case reached the Supreme Court over a year ago. But it said that before
it could rule on the case, the plaintiffs first had to comply with the DGI's
tax demand of hundreds of millions of dollars. They could then try to
recover the money by suing the DGI.
A tax lawyer explained that the DGI's apparently arbitrary claim was based
on legislation under which it could paradoxically rule a company was evading
taxes even if it acted legally. This is because transactions are not
assessed for tax on their legal 'appearance' but on their underlying 'real'
purpose.
The lawyer says: 'The government is never wrong. It is like Big Brother.
Argentina is a perverse country where something may be permitted one day and
the next day it has become a crime.'
Naturally, the government's view is rather different. The present head of
the DGI is Mr Carlos Tacchi, a tax lawyer before entering government last
year. He holds up the Koner-Salgado affair as an example of his offensive
against tax evasion, in which he does not discriminate between evaders, be
they large or small.
Although Mr Tacchi refused to be interviewed for this article, he has
claimed companies knew the credits were false all along. He says that, like
all other tax specialists - including the multinationals' advisers - he was
offered commissions to push the deep-discounted credits.
Mr Tacchi, who is as honest as he is ferociously efficient at collecting
taxes, implies that at best, companies were robbed by corrupt employees and
advisers. At worst, they actively dodged taxes.
Rather than begin long, expensive litigation in a judicial system not known
for its independence or impartiality, the companies decided to negotiate.
In the end, all but two accepted a compromise, their liability was reduced,
and they were given five years to pay.
But Firestone and BAT Industries' affiliate Nobleza-Piccardo decided to
fight. Their resistance is understandable: Firestone was originally asked
for Dollars 180m and Nobleza Dollars 130m.
Lobbying by the companies and the UK and US embassies achieved little. Last
October, a court froze Firestone's assets as a first step to its
liquidation. Firestone swiftly capitulated, followed by Nobleza.
Mr Tacchi offered them the same deal as the other multinationals. Nobleza,
which had bought Dollars 31m-worth of credits, was charged an extra Dollars
6.6m. It has begun paying the full Dollars 37.6m in 60 monthly instalments,
with the first nine due all at once. That is a heavy blow for a company with
an operating loss of Dollars 11.2m in the first nine months of 1991.
None of the companies considers payment as a recognition of guilt. Some are
demanding arbitration by an independent tribunal. But even if they do win,
the virtually bankrupt government will pay not with cash but with 16-year
bonds. Already, a secondary bond market is beginning to emerge.
Suspects at the DGI and Koner Salgado have yet to go on trial. But the
wheels of Argentina's justice have always ground slowly for the accused.
Massive financial fraud that cost the central bank Dollars 15.8bn during the
1980s has gone unpunished because so few of the suspects were ever brought
to trial.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Citibank Canada chief to leave

   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICK COPELAND, president of Citicorp's Canadian subsidiary, is taking
early retirement, apparently as a result of the bank's large exposure to
Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Toronto-based developer.
Late yesterday, a Citibank spokesman confirmed that Mr Copeland was leaving
'to pursue other interests'. The bank said he would stay until a successor
was named. Sources within the bank said staff had been given the news
earlier by Mr Copeland's New York-based superior, Mr Alan McDonald.
Citibank Canada has an exposure to O&amp;Y, both in its own capacity and as an
agent, totalling about CDollars 800m (USDollars 666.6m). Citicorp's
operations in other countries have also been heavy lenders to troubled real
estate developers, including the UK property group, Mountleigh, which
collapsed last week.
Citibank Canada is the second largest foreign-owned bank in Canada, with
assets of CDollars 5.5bn on January 31.
However, even before the O&amp;Y problems, its performance had been lacklustre.
The bank earned CDollars 5.1m in the first quarter, giving a return on
equity of only 4.2 per cent. The full extent of losses from O&amp;Y is likely to
be more apparent in results for the second quarter, which ended on April 30.
Citicorp said in a recent submission to the US Securities and Exchange
Commission that it had written off USDollars 101m of loans to O&amp;Y, and
classified the remaining USDollars 279m as non-performing.
Mr Copeland, 50, has worked for Citicorp since he graduated from university
in 1967.
Salomon Brothers said it was moving its head of non-Japanese Asia-Pacific
business, Mr Gavin Farley, to Europe to head up its corporate finance
efforts in the UK and France, AP-DJ reports from London.
Mr Farley, a Briton, will take up the new post in August after four years as
head of the Asia-Pacific unit. Replacing him in Asia will be Mr Thomas
Jasper, who has been head of Asian accounts in the US.
Mr Farley has been with Salomon Brothers for nine years. He was formerly
with Morgan Stanley and Citibank.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Warner fails to commit to Sony
Mini Disc

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WARNER Music Group, a division of US entertainment giant Time Warner, has
declined to commit its roster of artists to the new Mini Disc audio
technology format being developed by Sony of Japan.
Mini Disc is a portable recording and playback system which Sony is due to
launch in Japan in November and which it hopes will eventually become the
main successor to the analog cassette tape.
In a statement, Warner said it was still addressing the relative merits of
Mini Disc and its main rival, the digital compact cassette being developed
by Dutch group Philips.
Sony was putting on a brave face yesterday. A spokesman in New York said:
'We are happy that Warner is reviewing the two technologies equally.'
Warner is reluctant to commit itself to the new digital technology because
of concern that new formats may crimp the growth of compact discs (CDs)and
to a lesser extent, cassette tapes.
Mr Robert Morgado, in his role as chairman of Warner Music Group, said:
'Compact Disc is the premier carrier for the music industry and we are
asking manufacturers to assure us that their new technologies do not
adversely impact CDs continued growth.'
The decision by Warner not to back the Mini Disc is a blow to Sony's hopes
for the product. In order for Mini Disc to succeed, Sony must offer a wide
range of music titles to potential buyers of Mini Disc players when the
product enters the market later this year. Yet so far only two big labels,
EMI Music and Sony's own music division, have signed up with Mini Disc.
Sony had hoped Warner with its powerful roster of stars including Madonna
and Rod Stewart, would prove an important recruit.
To date, Philip's digital compact cassette format appears to have a head
start on Sony's Mini Disc. It has already won artist commitments from the
six biggest labels in the music industry for the product's September launch.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Zider to apple lager - country smocks to
urban image / A look at the forthcoming market flotation of Taunton Cider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WAS when cider conjured up images of the rural English idyll;
felt-capped yokels leaning on five-bar gates, straw between teeth and
scrumpy at hand. More prosaically it was gentlemen of the road, or students,
sliding comatose from their seats after availing of one of the most
cost-effective ways of getting drunk.
Neither image is exactly what the large commercial cider makers want. Over
the past decade, HP Bulmer and Taunton Cider, the UK's two largest
producers, have spent large amounts advertising an altogether different  -
they say contemporary - image.
Among their greatest challenges has been to make a cider that can be drunk
in 'sessionable quantities', a piece of exquisite marketing-speak referring
to the search for a cider whose taste will not stop drinkers in their tracks
after a few pints - even if its strength will.
While cider's image is far from reconstructed, the repositioning of the
product appears to have been remarkably successful. Last year, when the UK
drinks market shrank 5 per cent, cider sales volume rose by 3 per cent in
spite of the bad summer and the recession. From a position of 2.5 per cent
market share 20 years ago, one in every 20 pints drunk in the UK today is
cider.
It is into this background that Taunton Cider, the west country company
founded 90 years ago, is to come to the stock market early next month. The
flotation is likely to put a valuation of Pounds 130m-Pounds 150m on the
company which its management bought from a consortium of brewers, including
Bass, Courage and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, in May last year for Pounds 72.5m.
Such a rapid transition, and at such a premium, might suggest that the
buy-out team bought Taunton for a song. But Mr Peter Adams, chief executive
and managing director since 1987 and one of the team that with employees put
up 15 per cent of the Pounds 3.3m initial capital, insists this was not the
case.
'At the time of the buy-out there was great uncertainty,' he says. 'We had
broken free from our previous partners and there was concern over how well
we could perform.' At the same time the EC was contemplating applying much
higher wine excise duties to cider - a move Brussels has now decided not to
make - and the Gulf war was in full swing. In any case, Schroders, the
merchant bank, oversaw the trade sale to ensure the management team had no
advantage.
While the uncertainty may have been there, foundations were in place for
impressive growth. operating profit rose from Pounds 5m in 1987 to Pounds
12.5m last year and James Capel, the company's brokers, expect operating
profit of Pounds 16m for the year to last April.
'The sea change in the cider market came in the late 1970s when draft cider
became widely available in bars,' says Mr Adams. Taunton's Dry Blackthorn
and Bulmer's Strongbow began to grow rapidly, with Taunton increasing its
market share from 18.7 per cent in 1975 to 33.4 per cent in 1991, compared
to Bulmer's 45 per cent share.
Then in 1986, Taunton launched Diamond White, designed to compete with
premium lagers such as Holsten Pils and Becks, but with a significantly
bigger kick.
This was followed in 1989 with the launch of Red Rock, backed by an
advertising campaign featuring actor Leslie Nielson, star of the US Police
Squad series, that is as expensive as it is eccentric. Red Rock is aimed at
the lager drinker and, Mr Adams says, lacks the bitter-sweet edge of Dry
Blackthorn that tends to sate the palate too quickly for the sake of healthy
sales.
Cider's transformation to something the style-conscious drinker felt good
being seen with is reflected in the premium ciders' share of Taunton's
sales. Growing 20 per cent year on year, premium ciders now account for 25
per cent of Taunton's sales volume and 40 per cent of sales.
These developments were taking place as the brewers' stranglehold on
distribution was being loosened by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The March 1989 order that there should be more competition between brewers
and a restriction of the tied system gave the buy-out team the opportunity
to go independent, with the prospect of a freer market for their product.
Mr Adams then put his own bid together, backed by Samuel Montagu and Morgan
Grenfell Development Capital, at the same time as he was supplying Schroders
with the information other bidders would need for a trade sale.
Barely 14 months after the successful buy-out, Taunton is ready for the
market and hoping to float at a rating somewhere between Bulmer and Guinness
at a multiple of about 16.
The flotation is likely to raise about Pounds 70m which will be used to
repay all Pounds 41m loan stock and mezzanine debt and all but Pounds 10m of
bank debt, leaving the company with pro-forma gearing of 44 per cent.
It is almost guaranteed to lead to jollity in Taunton where all but eight of
the company's 500 employees became shareholders, albeit on a modest scale,
in the buy-out. A rather larger glass will be raised by Mr Adams' management
team which will be retaining about 4 per cent of the company.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Dunhill to buy Karl Lagerfeld fashion business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KARL LAGERFELD, the German designer who is one of the brightest stars of
French fashion, yesterday agreed to sell his business to Dunhill Holdings,
the British luxury goods group.
Lord Douro, chairman of Dunhill, said he paid 'less than FFr160m' (Pounds
16m) to buy Karl Lagerfeld from Revillon Luxe, the privately owned French
group which used to control it.
The Karl Lagerfeld business includes a Paris-based haute couture house, a
shop on the exclusive Rue du Faubourg St Honore near the Elysee palace, the
French company's trade marks, a franchise and a network of foreign
boutiques.
In return, Mr Lagerfeld has agreed to again become designer for Dunhill's
Chloe ready-to-wear fashions business, acquired by the British company in
1985. He will present his first Chloe collection in October, said Lord
Douro.
Mr Lagerfeld used to work for Chloe in the 1970s but left when Dunhill took
over. He was hired by Chanel where he is credited with having restored the
group's image and fortunes. It is understood that he will continue to design
collections for Chanel.
'This acquisition is evidence of our strategic objective to have a
significant investment in the female luxury fashion market worldwide,' said
Lord Douro.
'We look forward to further growth in the Lagerfeld and Chloe brand names
over the coming years,' he said. Both brands' distribution and franchise
networks would be enlarged.
There would be no senior management changes, so that Mr Ralph Toledano would
continue as Karl Lagerfeld's managing director and Mr Jean-Claude
Piedelievre will stay on as Chloe's managing director, said Lord Douro.
Several leading Parisian fashion houses are believed to be incurring losses,
after two years' of recession, worsened by the Gulf war. Like most of its
French competitors, Karl Lagerfeld does not publish results. It would be
surprising if it were not affected by the fashion industry downturn.
Dunhill also owns Mont Blanc pens and Hackett, a chain of classic English
clothing stores, as well as marketing its own brands of accessories and
clothes.
Christian Dior, the fashion house which was floated on the Paris stock
exchange last year, yesterday reported a 12.3 per cent net profits increase
for 1991.
The group, owned by Mr Bernard Arnault's Financiere Agache holding group,
made FFr902m net. Operating profits rose from FFr5.89bn to FFr6.53bn. Most
of the increase came from increased sales of champagne, spirits and luxury
baggage, and through Christian Dior's share of profits in the LVMH luxury
goods giant by way of a holding company which has 47.5 per cent of LVMH.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Big Six hit by recession and competition: Accountancy firms
cut staff - Audit work suffers / Growth in insolvency work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION and competition sharply reduced fee income growth in most of
Britain's six largest accountancy firms, according to figures for the year
to April 1992 released yesterday.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand remained the largest UK firm with fee income of Pounds
577m in the year to April 30, but also registered the only absolute decline,
with revenues down by 1.87 per cent.
All the top firms except Arthur Andersen cut professional staff including
partners by between 7 per cent and 10 per cent, reflecting the widespread
redundancies in the last few months.
Income from three of Coopers' divisions - audit, management consultancy and
tax - all declined, while insolvency income rose by 16 per cent. But the
firm said last year's reported Pounds 588m income had been adjusted
downwards to Pounds 577m, reflecting difficulties in calculation after the
merger with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells. The name Deloitte was also officially
dropped yesterday.
Strongest growth came from Arthur Andersen, mainly as a result of a 30 per
cent increase from Andersen Consulting. 'We're working with major
organisations which believe there's going to be a better tomorrow,' said Mr
Keith Burgess, head of the consulting arm.
Touche Ross also grew sharply, with income up by 15.7 per cent. Mr John
Roques, senior partner, said the increase reflected work referred from its
network of firms overseas, particularly in the USA and Japan, growing
consultancy work in Europe, and advice to medium-sized companies.
Revenue growth in the remaining firms - KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst &amp; Young,
and Price Waterhouse - was boosted by insolvency work but struggled to beat
inflation.
Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, said audit work was
suffering because of recession, overcapacity and intense competition.
However, none of the firms is willing to provide details of costs or profits
distributed to partners, stressing their legal status as partnerships does
not require them to do so.
They also argue it is very difficult to compare firms, which have different
year-ends and sometimes exclude income from regions such as the Channel
Islands. They say that some - particularly Andersen Consulting - operate in
distinctive markets and are not direct competitors.
Most of the managers in the firms suggested that the rapid income growth
experienced during the 1980s was unlikely to be repeated in the near future.
'Double-digit growth will tend to be a thing of the past,' said Mr Elwyn
Eilledge, senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young. 'We are concentrating now on
managing the numbers to suit our business.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Serbs defy UN to hit Sarajevo: Energy supplies may be
rationed as international sanctions begin to bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Bosnian capital of Sarajevo last night came under heavy bombardment from
Serb irregular forces in defiance of United Nations sanctions and an
agreement to implement a ceasefire.
The bombardment, which started less than two hours after the ceasefire was
due to come into effect, appeared to indicate that power is passing to local
Serbian warlords in Sarajevo and opposing Bosnian militia groups.
The renewed fighting raises the question of whether authorities in Belgrade,
the capital of Serbia, can control their irregular forces.
In response to the sanctions, Serbia yesterday sent General Zivota Panic,
commander of the Yugoslav federal army, to Sarajevo where he was due to hold
talks with Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic. The two were to discuss
implementing the ceasefire, which was to start at 1600 GMT yesterday.
The fighting took place as Serbia prepared for energy rationing to offset
the impact of the sanctions, designed to put pressure on the republic to
stop the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. President Slobodan Milosevic vowed that
Serbs would never bow to international pressure. 'The people have said that
they want to be masters of their own destiny,' he said.
The sanctions, as tough as those imposed on Iraq in 1990, are already
beginning to bite. Mr Nikola Sainovic, Serbia's minister of energy, said oil
derivatives would soon be 'conserved', a signal that rationing was planned.
In the run-up to the deadline set for the ceasefire yesterday, Sarajevo
Radio reported that Serb militia had bombarded the city hall. One person was
killed and three were injured. According to the radio, at least 30 people
have been killed and 115 wounded in the past 24 hours in Bosnia and on the
borders with Croatia.
In Belgrade, President Milosevic said 'the great results' of Sunday's
parliamentary and local elections, which the main opposition parties
boycotted, supported the government's defiant stand.
'They (the results) are a reply to all those enemies outside, and
internally, who have conducted a campaign against the elections. The results
are of enormous significance for the democratic process,' he added. Final
results have not been announced.
The UN said it would begin talks today with the warring parties to try to
open Sarajevo airport for humanitarian supplies. In Belgrade, people were
buying up household goods while the long petrol queues grew even longer. The
black market currency rate in Belgrade rose sharply from 1,300 dinars to the
dollar to more than 1,700. The official rate is 323 dinars to the dollar.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Letter: The myth surrounding vocational training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LESLEY ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I express my amusement at your article 'Vocational tests body comes
under attack' (May 28). Part of the problem in this debate is that everyone
is trying to compare apples with pears.
The competence-based approach quite rightly (if you are an employer) insists
that the key issue is that an individual demonstrates his or her ability to
do a particular job competently. It recognises that, to do so, the person
needs some theoretical knowledge, but it focuses primarily on the
acquisition of appropriate skills. How sensible]
The traditional academic approach quite rightly (if you are trying to
develop an academic) concentrates on giving a large amount of knowledge but
training the student in a limited range of skills, primarily research,
analysis and argument.
Unfortunately, somewhere along the road a lot of business training was
developed using the academic model. The competency approach is demonstrating
just how poorly the other translates into practical skills. This is the real
cause for all the academic sound and fury.
Your own final paragraph continued with the woolly thinking and typical
British snobbery that has dominated this debate. It implies that it is
strange to consider a set of practical competences, including handling
documents and answering phone calls, as equivalent to a GCSE. Why?
As both a graduate in physics and an experienced manager, I find no
difficulty in recognising the breadth of competences defined by the
Management Charter Initiative level 1 (NVQ level 4) for example, as broadly
equivalent to my degree course.
Yours is a respected newspaper; please do not continue to propagate the myth
that the ability to demonstrate academic knowledge is much more difficult or
important than demonstrating a range of administrative, managerial or
practical skills.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Letter: Rates burden having destructive effect on empty
properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PATTISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The present 'empty rates' regime is leading to a depressing bout of
destruction similar to that of the 1980s when roofs were taken off factories
to escape liability for rates. Industrial property and warehouses have since
become exempt, but offices remain liable. We know of one major plc currently
thinking of 'stripping out' an office block in the City in order to avoid a
rate liability of Pounds 1.5m. The property would have little potential for
redevelopment even in a bullish market. The current state of the market
makes it virtually unlettable.
The government must act immediately to stop this destructive course. The
period of grace should be extended from three months to one year and the
liability itself reduced to 40 per cent followed by further phased
reductions. Unless action is taken, this highly destructive process of
'stripping out' is bound to continue. Such a situation does little to
enhance the image of our system of business taxation, the prestige of the
City of London and the position of business ratepayers generally.
The Non-Domestic Rating Bill currently before parliament will do much to
help businesses suffering from the combined effect of the introduction of
the uniform business rate and the 1990 revaluation. But the bill offers no
help to those businesses facing huge liabilities for property which is
unoccupied.
Empty rate liability - currently 50 per cent of the total liability
following a three-month period of grace after occupation ceases - was
introduced to discourage developers from deliberately keeping property
empty. The notorious case of Centre Point in the 1960s highlighted the
problem. Since then, however, times have changed and nobody welcomes having
empty property on their hands.
The collapse of the commercial property market - the effects of which have
been particularly marked in the City of London - has thrown the unfairness
of empty rate liability into stark relief.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Key is not to produce less - but differently / Exploring the
meaning of sustainable development and the difficulties of putting this idea
into practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How could anyone be in favour of 'unsustainable development'? It would be
like favouring matricide, the victim being Mother Earth.
Yet what precisely is 'sustainable development'? Sustainable development,
says the World Commission on Environment and Development, consists of 'forms
of progress which meet the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their needs'.
That does not make one wiser. Try this, instead: '. . . In the end,
sustainable development is not a fixed state of harmony, but rather a
process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of
investments, the orientation of technological development, and institutional
change are made consistent with future as well as present needs.'
This is merely wordier. What, above all, are future needs? Citizens of rich
countries would number among them a standard of living at least as high as
that enjoyed today. To most of the world's poor that would be no more
related to 'need' than is a Rolls-Royce motor car to cost-effective
transportation. Fundamentalist environmentalists, who often advocate
something like the medieval manorial economy, would agree.
How then can the concept of 'sustainable development' be made operational?
One way is to recommend that the capital stock be maintained. More narrowly
still, it is suggested that not the total capital stock, but the stock of
natural resources alone should be maintained. The reason for this
restriction is evident. How many miles of road are worth one rhinoceros?
Among the rules suggested for use of the natural capital stock is that there
should be 'no net losses', meaning that any natural resources should be
replaced. Another is 'assume the worst': any action affecting the
environment is guilty, unless proved innocent.
Yet how many acres of wetlands compensate for a forest? Is a glamorous
species on the savanna worth two obscure ones in the rain forest? Unless one
advocates the impossible - actions that have no deleterious effect on any
ecosystem - the commandment that natural capital must be preserved takes one
little further.
The World Commission asserts that sustainable development, 'with its concern
for the needs of people today and tomorrow, is ultimately a moral and
ethical issue'. But that is all it appears to be. It is not a policy.
Nevertheless, one thought is buried within it: that the globe's ecosystems
have limited carrying capacity.
The idea has intuitive appeal. Over the last generation gross global product
(GGP) has been growing at more than 3 per cent a year. At that rate, GGP
would be 1,600 times greater 250 years from now. Either growth would have
ceased long before, or the composition of output would be so different as to
be incomparable. Just contrast today's output with that of 1742.
This notion is the basis for the relative optimism of the World Bank's World
Development Report on Development and the Environment. 'The key to growing
sustainably is not to produce less,' it opines, 'but to produce
differently.'
The report argues that there is no linear relationship between economic
activity and environmental damage. On the contrary, the emission of many
important pollutants has declined with development. This may not be true of
municipal waste and carbon dioxide emissions, which have continued to rise
with income. But that, suggests the report, is because there have been no
incentives for changed behaviour.
The World Bank asserts that the link between economic growth and the
environment depends on four factors:
structure: the goods and services produced;
efficiency: the quantity of inputs per unit of output;
substitution: the ability to substitute for scarce resources; and
technology and management: the environmental damage per unit of input or
output.
The report also offers a strategy for 'sustainable development', defining
that term as 'development that lasts'. This has three elements:
build on the positive links: many policies that promote growth - appropriate
energy prices, for example - will also improve the environment;
break the negative links: introduce appropriate incentives and
disincentives; and
clarify and manage uncertain links: where the consequences of human activity
are unknown, the response should be the search for further information,
combined with precautionary measures.
How can sustaining the natural environment or, where possible, improving it
be made consistent with development? The problem is market failure, the way
people can ignore the environment in their economic decisions. The solution
is to introduce environmental incentives.
Unfortunately, this conclusion is more easily written than implemented.
First, the use of non-marketed, but scarce resources, has to be reflected in
corporate and national accounts.
Second, rational incentives to improve the environment have to be introduced
against entrenched vested interests.
Third, many important environmental goods (and bads) - species diversity,
the composition of the atmosphere, the number of children people have -
cannot be property. Others, like rain forests, are difficult to protect.
Polluters should pay. But how much? And who will make them?
Fourth, turning hitherto 'free' goods into property or taxing their use
redistributes wealth, sometimes massively. Equally intractable
distributional questions arise when valuing the welfare of future
generations against that of those living now.
Finally, some problems run across frontiers. A few affect everyone.
Establishing, enforcing and distributing rights to pollute across countries
is vastly more difficult than doing that within them.
Nothing raises more difficulties than global warming. Both the size of the
threat and its potential economic costs are uncertain; the costs of lower
emissions for important interests would be large; the atmosphere is not
appropriable; emissions can only be monitored with difficulty; the way in
which rights to emit carbon dioxide are allocated would affect the
international distribution of income; and overall reductions in emissions
would influence inter-generational income distribution as well.
No wonder, developing countries argue that the rich countries want them to
stay poor, merely so that they themselves can continue their profligacy. No
wonder, too, that developing countries believe they now have goods to offer
 -more trees, more species, less carbon-dioxide - that the rich want still
more than they do.
Rio is just a start to the hard bargaining ahead. If environmental market
failure is, in fact, as great a problem as many now believe, a world as
divided as ours seems unlikely to deliver a solution.

While there is no such thing as a recession-proof industry, canny investors
might do worse than inspect the UK brassiere market. According to the
research organisation Mintel, British women spent Pounds 450m on 84m bras in
1991, up from Pounds 388m on 71m in 1989. The market is also changing shape.
There is a 'a swing towards the more glamorously styled, underwired bra',
and the average size has gone up to 36C from 34B in just ten years. The
manufacturers are putting the increase down to 'more exercise and the use of
the pill'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When it comes to political infighting, Italy's bankers are almost as
professional as their legislative neighbours. Hence there is some relief
that technocrat Giuseppe Zadra has seen off the opposition and collected the
directorship of Italy's bankers' association.
In many other countries the post would be regarded as a restbed for weary
commercial bankers. But not Italy. At a time when the country's fragmented
and inefficient banking system is on the brink of substantial change, Zadra
will be in a powerful position to influence the cause of sensible reform. He
will not be as easily swayed off course by political undercurrents as some
previous incumbents.
During his seven years as head of the stock market division at Consob,
Italy's stock exchange and companies' watchdog, the 51-year-old Zadra helped
transform Italian equity trading. A fluent English-speaker he has been a
tough defender of the new bourse rules against foreign critics.
Tancredi Bianchi, the professor of banking who chairs the bankers'
association, was so desperate to recruit Zadra that he reportedly threatened
to resign himself, if his colleagues baulked at his choice.

If Marcus Davison, a 42-year-old banker, had hung around at National
Westminster Bank as long as young Derek Wanless did, then he too might have
stood a chance of being group chief executive of Britain's second biggest
bank. However, Davison, like most of the more ambitious young graduates
entering British banking in the early 1970s, was bitten by the international
banking bug and therein lies a tale.
Whereas Wanless, a contemporary of Davison's at NatWest, has risen farther
and faster than anyone imagined, equally ambitious bankers such as Davison
have kept on losing their commands. Davison's first port of call after
NatWest was dear old Western American Bank, a casualty of the recession
before last. He left before the ship went down but was less lucky last week
when he lost his finance director's job after the the plug was pulled on DG
Investment Bank.
Can any reader beat Davison's unfortunate career record? All of the six
banks he has worked for are now but a memory in the headhunters' files. The
name plates of Davison's old employers such as European Asian Bank, European
Banking Company, and Philadelphia National Limited, have long since
disappeared. Indeed, Davison now wonders whether he should write to
prospective employers asking them to make him a modest subscription in
return for his promise never to darken their doors as an employee. With this
sort of capital he should be able to start his own bank.

Reformed Japanese gangsters are finding it hard to convince potential
employers that they can now toe the line.
It seems that gangsters wanting to quit their gang, following Japan's recent
crackdown on underworld activities, find that they often have to forfeit a
little finger as a punishment. As a result, many would-be good guys say that
their missing digit makes them particularly vulnerable now that they are
being forced to look for legitimate employment.
However, an entrepreneurial doctor from the north of the country has offered
to graft a toe in the place of the missing finger to make the problem less
obvious. So far, 20 repentant mobsters have mended their ways.

Anglo American, having long resisted token appointments of blacks to its
board, has now leapt into the deep end by making sociologist Dr Mamphela
Ramphele a non-executive director.
While Anglo is doubtless pleased about the symbolic effect of having a black
woman on the board, there is nothing tokenistic in the appointment. Indeed,
chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson's comment that she 'would bring a new
aspect to our deliberations' is an understatement.
Ramphele, a close friend of martyred black activist Steve Biko, who died in
police detention in 1976, is a formidable personality, likely to subject
Anglo's corporate practices to gruelling scrutiny. Indeed, the dialogue
between her and Anglo hard men like Graham Boustred and Lesley Boyd would be
worth paying good money to listen to.
A deputy vice-chancellor at Cape Town university, Ramphele made her name as
co-author with Dr Francis Wilson of an acclaimed study on poverty. She has
been helping Anglo in research to define affordable programmes to alleviate
hardship.
The company will have been attracted by Ramphele's robust liberalism,
combining championship of the oppressed with the tenet that the state must
not encourage a culture of entitlement. But will it be enough to stop those
who want Anglo broken up?
